# react-redux-seed

Seed project for react.js with redux babel and webpack.

## Note

Setting up a react environment can be messy, we can get lost between babel, redux, react-redux connectors, etc.
That's why this seed was created, it wires up everything from babel to redux, webpack 2, and the react-redux connectors.
